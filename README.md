# Synopsis
This Android application (for devices supporting Android 4.4 or later, minSdkVersion is 19 and targetSdkVersion is 27) to assist the elderly and allow them to be able to find nearby landmarks of interests and travel independently. It aims to provide the elderly with a clear walking plan to the nearby destination of interests based on their preferences, walking speed and distance. 

# Motivation
Independent travel for the elderly has always been a challenge in terms of difficulties in scheduling for an voluntary assistance and limitations in existing navigation apps. Though Apps like Google Maps provide users with multiple navigation suggestions, the elderly who have limited experience with modern technology may find them too complicated to use. Moreover, there are limited features to help users under the emergency situation or live chat option.

These main challenges turn out that the combination of manual help and technology would be the best solution for navigating the elder users.
