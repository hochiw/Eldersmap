/**
 *  The below link from google, saying that the test of Service requires Instrumented Unit Test,
 *  which is about UI/Integration test that is not required for the purpose of the subject.
 *  https://developer.android.com/training/testing/integration-testing/service-testing#java
 *  I personally assume that since the whole class is based on Google API yet the coding and
 *  functionality should be valid. No need for further testing.
